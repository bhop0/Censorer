## Usage

The `CensorBot` class can be utilized in your Python projects for detecting and handling offensive language. The example demonstrates a simple interactive use case where the user can input text, and the bot detects and outputs any detected bad words.

```python
from SimpleCensorBot.CensorBotV1 import CensorBot

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bot = CensorBot()

    while True:
        text = input("Enter a text (type 'exit' to end the program): ")

        if text.lower() == 'exit':
            print("Exiting the program.")
            break

        detected_words = bot.detector(text)
        if detected_words:
            print("Detected bad words:", detected_words)
        else:
            print("No bad words detected.")
```
